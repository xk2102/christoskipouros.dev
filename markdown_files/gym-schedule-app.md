# gym-schedule-app

This application intends to manage the schedule of a small gym operation. It keeps track of the sessions that happen every day as well as the trainers and the students.

There are 5 main pages and each has a list of actions that can be performed. These are:

- sessions (insert session, insert group session, edit session, select date)
- trainers (insert trainer, edit trainer)
- trainerSessions (select trainer, select date)
- students (insert student, edit student)
- studentSession (select student, select date)

This project is built using Bootstrap (HTML, CSS) and PHP.
