      <p>An automated trading strategy should be as simple as possible.</p>
      <p>
        It is a set of rules that needs to occur multiple times and be profitable. So it is clear that a simple set of rules will have a higher probability of happening again in the future than a more
        complex one.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this does not mean that the development of an automated trading strategy is a simple task. It consists of many stages under back-testing and forward-testing. All these stages should
        be very clear and transparent as any missed hidden costs could potentially build up and do damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such stages are direction and entry-stop-exit, money management and market selection, commissions and slippage, execution-feedback and adjustments for optimization but not over-optimization.
